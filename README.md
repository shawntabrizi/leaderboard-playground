# Leaderboard Playground

A Polkadot Playground starter template. A single-player game with an **on-chain leaderboard** — designed so the **game** and the **scoreboard backend** stay independent. Swap either one without touching the other.

Ships with Flappy Bird as the game and a PVM smart contract on Paseo Asset Hub as the leaderboard backend.

## What you need

- Node.js (>= 20) and npm or pnpm
- Rust nightly (`rustup install nightly`) and the [`cdm` CLI](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-dependency-manager)
- A Paseo account with a small PAS balance (testnet, free from [faucet.polkadot.io](https://faucet.polkadot.io))

`setup.sh` runs the npm install for you; the rest is one-time.

## First-run flow

```bash
# Frontend deps
npm install

# Smart contract — first-time CDM setup
cdm init -n paseo                  # generate keypair for Paseo
cdm account bal -n paseo           # print address; fund it at faucet.polkadot.io
cdm account map -n paseo           # one-time: register Revive H160 mapping

# Build & deploy the leaderboard contract
cdm build
cdm deploy -n paseo
cdm install @example/leaderboard-playground -n paseo

# Dev server
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The game starts immediately. Scores are saved to your deployed contract; the leaderboard reads them back live.

If you start `npm run dev` before deploying, the page renders with a banner explaining how to deploy. Submissions are disabled until the contract is in `cdm.json`.

## Publish to Playground

Once the game works locally, publish the contract and frontend to Polkadot Playground in one shot with [`dot`](https://github.com/paritytech/playground-cli):

```bash
dot deploy --contracts --playground --moddable
```

What each flag does:

- `--contracts` — compiles and deploys the leaderboard contract (replaces the manual `cdm deploy && cdm install` step above). The new address is written into `cdm.json`.
- `--playground` — publishes to the Playground registry so the app appears in your "my apps" list. The publish is signed by your account so the registry contract records you as the owner.
- `--moddable` — records this repo's URL in the Bulletin metadata so others can clone and mod the source with `dot mod`. Reads your existing `origin` and fails fast if it's missing, private, or not GitHub.

The CLI also uploads `dist/` to Bulletin Chain and registers a `.dot` domain via DotNS. Interactive prompts cover `--signer` (`phone` to sign with your account, `dev` for shared keys), `--domain` (DotNS label), and `--buildDir` (default `dist/`).

Prerequisites: run `dot init` once on a fresh machine to install `rustup`, `cdm`, `ipfs`, and `gh`, and to pair with the Polkadot mobile app. For `--moddable` you also need a public GitHub `origin` (this repo already has one).

contracts/leaderboard/lib.rs
  PVM smart contract — append-only enumeration + per-name personal best.
```

The seam is `GameComponentProps` (in [`src/games/types.ts`](src/games/types.ts)) on one side and `ScoreboardAPI` (in [`src/scoreboard/api.ts`](src/scoreboard/api.ts)) on the other. Anything implementing one of those is a drop-in.

## Identity model (read this)

This template uses a **shared dev signer** (`//Alice`) for every transaction, with the **display name** as the leaderboard identity. The contract stores best score per name, not per caller:

- **Pro:** zero auth UX, runs out of the box, multiple players differentiated by name.
- **Con:** anyone can submit any name. No anti-spoofing. Fine for a starter / hackathon demo, not for production.

Replacing `//Alice` with a real signer (extension, Polkadot Mobile, session key) is a documented mod — see [`docs/modding.md`](docs/modding.md). Adding caller-based identity to the contract is a documented quest in [`quests.json`](quests.json).

## Swap the game

A game is a React component that calls `onGameEnd(score)` exactly once when the match ends. Drop in any single-player game that produces a number — 2048, Snake, a clicker, a reaction-time test.

See [`docs/modding.md`](docs/modding.md) → "Swap the game" for the recipe.

## Swap the backend

The default backend is the on-chain contract. Two alternatives are interesting:

- **localStorage** (`src/scoreboard/local-impl.ts`) — still shipped. Useful for offline dev or tutorials where you want to demo the architecture without deploying.
- **Bulletin-augmented** — keep the contract for the index, write full match history to Bulletin Chain.

See [`docs/modding.md`](docs/modding.md) → "Swap the backend" for both.

## Mod ideas

See [`quests.json`](quests.json) for the full list. Highlights:

- **Swap the game** — anything producing a numeric score plugs in.
- **Caller-based identity** — change the contract to use `caller()` (the Revive H160 of the signer) instead of a display-name string. Requires a real signer.
- **Bulletin replay history** — store full match history off-chain, content-addressed; contract holds the index.
- **Cross-game scoring** — add `game_id` to the contract; multiple games share one leaderboard.

## Why this shape

A common failure mode for "starter" templates is to ship a complete demo where the game logic, the chain logic, and the UI are tangled. This template makes the seams explicit:

- The game produces a number.
- The scoreboard stores numbers.
- `App.tsx` is the only file that knows about both.

Mod the game without learning Polkadot. Mod the backend without touching the game. Both at once if you want — but the surfaces are independent.
